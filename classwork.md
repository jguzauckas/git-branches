To start understanding branching, this classwork asks you to do a few basic tasks.

Basic:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Create a commit on the new branch by adding/changing a file in the repository.
3. Push the new branch to GitHub.
4. Merge the new branch back into `main`.
5. Delete the new branch.
6. Push the `main` branch to GitHub.

Advanced:

1. Create two new branches.
2. Create at least one commit on each of the new branches.
3. Push both of the new branches to GitHub.
4. Merge one of your branches back into `main`. (simple merge)
5. Delete the branch that was just merged.
6. Push the `main` branch to GitHub.
7. Merge the other branch back into `main`. (complex merge)
8. Delete the other branch.
9. Push the `main` branch to GitHub.
